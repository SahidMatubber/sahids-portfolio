            <h3>A Fullstack Web Developer</h3>
            <p>I am proud to have a unique background that combines system engineering, computer networking, and
                software
                development. In my various roles, I have found myself regularly called upon to tackle technical
                challenges,
                resolve coding issues and engage with different teams working on different projects. My love of coding
                drives me internally and I relish every opportunity to tackle the deepest technical challenges. From
                developing a user-friendly frontend to building reliable web servers, I've worked on many projects.</p>

            <h3>Become a web developer</h3>
            <p>Having learned any one of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or your first programming language, the next step
                generally is to gain mastery of the language(s), build fun stuff, get mentorship, get an internship or
                an entry-level position where you can gain experience by working on live projects. Here are a few
                suggestions for the things you might want to do next.</p>
